# SIT215-Final-Project
This repository contains the code related to the Deakin SIT215 Investigating Reinforcement Learning Project.

# Agents and Environments
Three agents have been developed:

1.Random Agent

2.QLearner Agent

3.TDLearner Agent

Three OpenAI Gym environments were used:

1.Taxi-v3

2.Cartpole-v1

3.FrozenLake-v0

Training and evaluation runs for combinations of agent and environemnt are placed together through a driver.


# Usage
The machine need sto have Gym environment installed and python v3.5+

Run the code files in Jupyter notebook 
The following runs are available in each file accordingly:

Taxi, Random Agent

Taxi, QLearner Agent

Cartpole, Random Agent

Cartpole, QLearner Agent

Cartpole, TDLearner Agent

Frozen Lake, Random Agent

Frozen Lake, QLearner Agent

Frozen Lake, TDLearner Agent

Simply uncommenting the code should work.
